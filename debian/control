Description: Induced Pluripotent Stem Computing Cell - common files
 iPS is a small operating system which hosts isolated
 systems on it. Each environment running the operating system
 is called 'iPS cell' which can be controlled and managed by
 its RPC API and managed by iPS Manager by using the API.
 .
 This package contains common files used by both iPS cell
 and Manager.

Description: Induced Pluripotent Stem Computing Cell - Simple monitoring daemon
 This package contains varzd daemon which collects system information in
 the same format used in iPS cell monitoring. By installing this daemon, you
 can monitor your own system which is not a part of iPS cells, in iPS cell
 monitoring framework.
